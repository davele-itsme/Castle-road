<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Unity game inspired by <strong>Crossy road</strong> game on mobile platforms. Castle road combines <strong>Arcade runner</strong> genre with <strong>RPG</strong> elements. 
The game for some reason lags in WebGL, so I recommend building the standalone app and run the game there. Tested building "PC, Mac & Linux Standalone" and the game runs smooth.

<strong>Features:</strong>
* Spawning of enemies attacking you
* Spawning of obstacles when running
* Boss fight at the end of the journey

* [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) - lightweight GPU-based voxel art editor for modelling
* [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/) - library with full-body character animations and autorigging
* [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) - store with Unity Assets
